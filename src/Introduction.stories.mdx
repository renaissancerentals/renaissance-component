# Renaissance Rentals Storybook

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.
Storybook takes [**component-driven**](https://componentdriven.org) approach to building UI, starting with atomic components and ending with pages.

Browse stories by navigating them in the sidebar, view code in the **Docs** view.
